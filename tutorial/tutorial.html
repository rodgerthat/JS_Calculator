    *Query* should i roll in SASS?

    In this Lesson you're going to build a simple javascript-based calculator.

    Give the students the HTML

    Phase 1 )

        The first thing you're going to do is build an HTML / CSS calculator from scratch, using the skills
        you've learned in previous web classes. NO TABLES. You must use valid HTML5 / CSS3. And make it pretty for
        goodness sakes, ya'll are designers, after all.
        I would prefer if the markup was all from scratch, to prove you can roll your own frontend markup,
        but if you want to roll in a frontend framework like Bootstrap or Foundation I won't take off much.
        Requirements : It has to have a 'C' or clear button, numbers 0 - 9, a decimal button '.', the four
        common arithmatic operators, '+', '-', '*', 'รท' <- If  you need the division symbol just copy it from here
        However, for this tutorial we're going to use the computer's computational equivalents, to get you thinking
        in those terms, so use +, -, *, and / instead. bonus points if you can CSS in the normal englishy equivalents
        visually over teh
        Lastly, it needs a '=' button.
        Oh yeah, it also needs an element for the display! duh.

        As far as the CSS goes, a few reccommendations to make your life easier when we get to the JS part.
        1 ) make sure your keys all have a class 'key'.
        2 ) make sure your display element has a class 'display'
        3 ) give all  your operator keys the class 'operator'
        3.5 ) make sure your clear key has the class 'clear'
        4 ) Make it pretty dangit. or go super minimalisty.
        5 ) The challenge here is to see if you can do it in less code than I did. hehehehehehe.

    Phase 2 )

        Now we're going to add functionality to it via javascript. To do that, you have to think about what the
        real world version of a calculator does. Well, at the very base level.
        (no, not like, integrated circuitry w/ logic gates...)
        (y'all have no idea how freakin' luck y'all are that JS has an 'eval' function)
        You push some buttons, and little pictographic symbols that represent numbers show up on it,
        and when you push the '=' button it performs the operation you told it to, and with some luck
        gives you the correct answer and spares your brain the trauma of simple arithmatic so you can spend
        more time contemplating the recent influx of 'cash me outsiii, how bout dah?' memes.


    Basic Prep :

        Create a calculator.js file in the same directory as
        Add a line to the head of your calculator.html file to include a javascript file
        <code> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/calculator.js"></script> </code>

        Part of this class is to affirm good programming practices and file and code organization / readability is key
